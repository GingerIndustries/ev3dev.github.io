title: "Announcing ev3dev-jessie-2017-09-14 Release"

This is a stable maintenance release. We've pulled in the updates and security
fixes from [Debian 8.9](https://www.debian.org/News/2017/2017072202) and the
most recent ev3dev kernel.

There is a fix that should make Bluetooth start more reliably on the EV3 (i.e.
Bluetooth shows as "Unavailable" until the EV3 is rebooted).

The only other notable change is for those with the [color screen hack](/news/2015/07/24/Color-LCD-on-the-EV3/),
a crash at boot is fixed.

Most of our work has been focused on **ev3dev-stretch**. It is nearing beta
quality, so you might want to [check it out](https://docs.ev3dev.org/en/ev3dev-stretch/).
